CSS UTILS

[中文README](README_CN.md)


What's this repo?
---
This is a repo for those coders who's not good at CSS, for example: myself :no_mouth:. It will help you quickly finish the common CSS styles like shapes, animations, and others I can't think of for now(but will). I don't like long codes to describe the styles so I try my best to keep it simple, so that you can just copy and paste them to see the result.
